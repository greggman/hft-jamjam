JamJam
=================

This is a sample game for the [HappyFunTimes party games system](http://greggman.github.io/HappyFunTimes).

A collective drum sequencer. Each player has one drum they can set the sequence for.
All the machines are synced using a `SyncedClock`. Each player must turn on the volume
on their phone so everyone can hear their drum.

FYI: This is still a work in progress. Timing seems to be synced on iOS devices but
not Android.
